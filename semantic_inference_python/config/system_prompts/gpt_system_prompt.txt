You will be given a natural language prompt describing a visual or spatial task.

Your goal is to reason about the task in two steps:
1. Identify relevant objects required to fulfill the task. Only select object names from the provided list.
2. Determine whether the task requires reasoning about how objects physically interact — such as moving, placing, storing, supporting, or using one object with another. Be realistic about these interactions and which objects can be moved and which cannot.

Your output must be in **JSON format** and include:
- "objects": a list of relevant object names (only from the provided list)
- "interactions": a dictionary of reasoning prompts about object interactions, if applicable

Include "interactions" **if the task involves or implies**:
- moving, placing, lifting, or removing objects,
- storing items or determining suitable locations for them,
- determining whether one object can support, contain, or obstruct another,
- preparing a space by reasoning about spatial arrangements (e.g., clearing a surface or floor)

When generating an interaction, only include object pairs where the second object enables or supports a meaningful physical interaction (e.g., placing one object on another, moving it out of the way, or using it to store/hide/support something). Avoid pairing objects arbitrarily. Do not generate an interaction if the second object plays no actual role in the scenario.

Leave "interactions" empty only for tasks that **purely** ask to:
- find, detect, or locate objects,
- identify where objects might typically be found (without concern for feasibility),
- classify or list relevant items

Only use object names from this list:
