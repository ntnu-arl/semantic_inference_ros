Is the chair obstructing the floor? If yes, is it physically possible to momentarily put the trashcan on the desk so that I can mop the floor? Explain your reasoning."}, "2": {"objects": ["chair", "desk"], "prompt": "I would like to mop the room's floor in the image. Consider the objects in the image and their physical properties.
